# Supply-Chain-Project</d>

## Objective:
This project, completed as part of the Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics, aimed to optimize inventory distribution for an FMCG company that recently entered the instant noodles market. The company faced demand-     supply mismatches across warehouses, leading to stock shortages in high-demand areas and overstocking in low-demand regions. The goal was to develop a predictive model that determines the optimum shipment weight for each warehouse and analyze demand patterns across different regions to guide inventory allocation and targeted marketing.
