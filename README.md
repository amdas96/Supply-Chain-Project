# Supply-Chain-Project</d>

## Objective:
This project, completed as part of the Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics, aimed to optimize inventory distribution for an FMCG company that recently entered the instant noodles market. The company faced demand-     supply mismatches across warehouses, leading to stock shortages in high-demand areas and overstocking in low-demand regions. The goal was to develop a predictive model that determines the optimum shipment weight for each warehouse and analyze demand patterns across different regions to guide inventory allocation and targeted marketing.

##Project Overview: Supply Chain Optimization Using Machine Learning

Objective:

This project, completed as part of the Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics, aimed to optimize inventory distribution for an FMCG company that recently entered the instant noodles market. The company faced demand-supply mismatches across warehouses, leading to stock shortages in high-demand areas and overstocking in low-demand regions. The goal was to develop a predictive model that determines the optimum shipment weight for each warehouse and analyze demand patterns across different regions to guide inventory allocation and targeted marketing.

Approach & Methodology:

âœ… Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Processed a dataset of 25,000 warehouse records with 24 key features related to demand, storage capacity, transportation efficiency, and competitor presence.

Handled missing values using median and mode imputation and treated outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

Encoded categorical variables with One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding and standardized numerical features using Z-score normalization.


âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis & Clustering:

Conducted correlation analysis to identify key factors influencing demand.

Used K-Means Clustering to segment warehouses into three groups based on refill frequency, logistics efficiency, and competitor activity.


âœ… Predictive Modeling:

Built multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.

Gradient Boosting Regression was selected as the best-performing model, achieving an RÂ² score of 99.41% after hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).


âœ… Model Deployment & Business Insights:

Predicted the optimal shipment weight for each warehouse with high accuracy, reducing inventory mismanagement.

Identified high-demand areas requiring frequent refills and underutilized warehouses needing resource optimization.

Recommended logistics improvements for warehouses facing transportation bottlenecks.

Business Impact & Future Scope:

ðŸš€ Optimized inventory distribution, minimizing stockouts & overstocking.
ðŸš€ Improved supply chain efficiency, reducing logistics costs & storage losses.
ðŸš€ Enabled AI-driven demand forecasting, leading to better decision-making.

Future improvements include integrating real-time IoT data, external market factors (competitor pricing, seasonal demand), and AI-driven automated replenishment systems to further enhance warehouse efficiency and profitability.
